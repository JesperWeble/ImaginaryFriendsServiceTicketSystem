# Handling Per-Computer Settings File in Git

If you have a settings file that contains machine-specific configurations (e.g., paths, API keys, or other per-computer data) in your repository and you no longer want Git to track changes to it, you can use Git's `assume-unchanged` feature. This allows you to keep the file in your local repository but prevent any changes from being tracked in version control.

## Steps to Ignore Future Changes to a Settings File Locally

### 1. **Mark the file as unchanged**

To tell Git to **stop tracking changes** to your settings file (while keeping it in your working directory), run the following command:

```bash
git update-index --assume-unchanged <path-to-your-file>
```

For example, if your settings file is located in `config/settings.json`, use:

```bash
git update-index --assume-unchanged config/settings.json
```

This will **ignore any future changes** to `settings.json` and prevent them from being staged or committed, while still leaving the file in your local working directory.

### 2. **Check if the file is being ignored**

After running the above command, Git will not track changes to the file. You can confirm this by running:

```bash
git status
```

You should no longer see `settings.json` as an untracked or modified file in the status output.

### 3. **Revert if needed**

If you later decide that you want Git to track the file again (i.e., you want to undo this setting), you can run:

```bash
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged <path-to-your-file>
```

For example, to re-enable tracking for `settings.json`:

```bash
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged config/settings.json
```

This will allow Git to track future changes to the file again.

### 4. **Important Notes**

- This method **only affects your local repository** and will not impact other collaborators or repositories.
- The file will still exist in the repository for other users to pull, but **local changes wonâ€™t be tracked** unless you choose to revert this setting.

This approach is ideal when you have a machine-specific configuration file that you don't want to modify across all environments but still want to keep it in the repository.
